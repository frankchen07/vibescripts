# homebrew-checker

vibecoded program to check applications on macosx to see if they are installed by homebrew or not, and if it's supported by homebrew or not

output is application | supported by homebrew? | installed by homebrew?

this was just to determine which apps i needed to uninstall (b/c dmg installation) and use homebrew for easy updates in the future
