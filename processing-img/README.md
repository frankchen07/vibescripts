# converting heif/heics to high quality jpegs

`zscriptConvertHEIC.swift`

this is a script attempt at automating conversion from heif/heic to the highest quality jpeg, just like if you did it manually in preview

the problem still occurs that some conversion codec is different and the contrast feels lower in the script conversion (manual feels brighter and more stark)

`zscriptExtractPDF.sh`
- breaks a multi-page pdf into single pdf files, one page each
